# Microstack

> Automated, scalable, and secure infrastructure stack for microservies on DigitalOcean

Microstack is an attempt at creating a fully codified and automated production infrastructure for microservices running on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com). A core philosophy of the project is to always use The Right Toolâ„¢ for the job and never rely on convoluted and potentially unreliable scripts. Servers should bootstrap and configure themselves using as little code as possible and operators should be able to easily reason about this code.
